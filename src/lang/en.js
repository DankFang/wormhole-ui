    a1: 'To be updated... By using graphene technology, Wormhole3 can generate a Web3 id for each user, and derive its low-privilege Web3_social id. The private key of the Web3 id is uniquely held by the user, and the Web3_social id is delegated to the user\'s Web2 account (such as Twitter) in a decentralized manner. This has brought about a huge change. On the Web2 platform, users can control the Web3_social id, such as tweeting on the Twitter page to upload posts on the chain and tweeting to transfer cryptocurrencies. There is no need to install any Web3 plug-in wallet in the whole process, and there is no need to consider issues such as handling fees.ðŸ˜Ž'
