          Hey Wallet is a cryptocurrency wallet where you can send and receive SOL using tweets.
          After signing up and depositing crypto into your account, you can tweet something like
          "@hey_wallet send 1 SOL to @TheRock" and it will transfer 1 SOL from your account to
          the recipient's account (in this case, The Rock). We are currently focused on Solana
          because of its high speed and low fees. The average wait time for a transaction is 6 seconds.
